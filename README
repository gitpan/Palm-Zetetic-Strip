This is Palm-Zetetic-Strip, a set of Perl 5 modules for reading Palm
database (PDB) files containing data from the Strip application from
Zetetic.  Currently only read-only access is provided to the PDB
files.  Versions 0.5i and 1.0 of Strip are supported.  Strip may be
found here:

  http://www.zetetic.net/

Preqeuisites
------------

In addition to this module and Strip installed on your Palm, you will
need the following modules, all of which may be found on CPAN.

1) p5-Palm (Palm::PDB)

   Required to read the PDB files.

2) Crypt::IDEA
3) Digest::MD5

   Only required to decrypt Strip v0.5i databases.  If you have no
   need to decrypt v0.5i databases, you need not install these
   modules.

4) Crypt::Rijndael
5) Digest::SHA256

   Only required to decrypt Strip v1.0 databases.  If you have no
   need to decrypt v1.0 databases, you need not install these modules.

Installing
----------

Once you have all the prequisites installed, just follow these
instructions:

  1) perl Makefile.PL
  2) make
  3) make test
  4) make install

Exmaple Script
--------------

An example script to dump a Strip database is included called
"strip.pl".  It takes one argument which is a directory containing the
three Strip PDB files:

  StripPassword-SJLO.pdb
  StripSystems-SJLO.pdb
  StripAccounts-SJLO.pdb

It will then prompt you for your Strip password.  If correct, it will
dump the contents of the databases to standard output.  For example:

  % strip_dump t/data/v1.0/
